## Mathematical Formulation of the Objective Function

### Objective Function

The objective of the portfolio optimization is to maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. This can be mathematically represented as:

\[
\text{Maximize } E(R_p) - \frac{\lambda}{2} \sigma_p^2
\]

Where:
- \( E(R_p) \) is the expected return of the portfolio.
- \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the variance of the portfolio returns, representing risk.
- \( \lambda \) is the risk aversion coefficient, indicating the trade-off between risk and return.

### Variables

- **Weights (\( w_i \))**: The proportion of the total portfolio value allocated to asset \( i \).
- **Expected Returns (\( E(R_i) \))**: The anticipated return for asset \( i \).
- **Covariance Matrix (\( \Sigma \))**: A matrix representing the covariance between the returns of different assets.

### Constraints

1. **Budget Constraint**:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1
   \]
   The total investment must equal the available capital.

2. **Weight Constraints**:
   \[
   w_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i
   \]
   Each weight must be non-negative, meaning no short selling is allowed.

### Conclusion

By solving this optimization problem, we can determine the optimal asset weights that maximize the expected return while adhering to the specified constraints.
