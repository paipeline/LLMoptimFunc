# Combined Optimization Formula

## Introduction

This document presents a combined optimization formula that integrates maximizing returns, minimizing risk, and maximizing the Sharpe ratio into a single objective function.

## Combined Optimization Formula

The combined optimization objective can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \alpha \cdot R_T - \beta \cdot \text{Var}(R) + \gamma \cdot S
\]

Where:
- \( Z \) is the overall objective to maximize.
- \( R_T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t \) is the total return.
- \( \text{Var}(R) = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (R_t - \bar{R})^2 \) is the variance of returns (risk).
- \( S = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma_R} \) is the Sharpe ratio.
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are weights that determine the importance of each component in the optimization process.

This formula allows traders to balance their focus on returns, risk, and risk-adjusted performance based on their specific trading goals and market conditions.
