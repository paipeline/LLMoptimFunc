# Quadratic Portfolio Optimization Plan

## Objective
To maximize the expected return of the portfolio while minimizing risk through diversification.

## Variables

### 1. Asset Returns
- **Expected Returns**: The anticipated return for each asset in the portfolio.

### 2. Asset Weights
- **Weights**: The proportion of the total portfolio value allocated to each asset.

### 3. Covariance Matrix
- **Covariance**: A matrix representing the covariance between the returns of different assets.

### 4. Risk Metrics
- **Volatility**: The standard deviation of asset returns, representing risk.
- **Beta**: A measure of the asset's risk in relation to the market.

### 5. Financial Metrics
- **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: A valuation ratio calculated by dividing the market price per share by the earnings per share.
- **Price to Book (P/B) Ratio**: A ratio used to compare a company's current market price to its book value.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: A measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity.

### 6. Constraints
- **Budget Constraint**: The total investment must equal the available capital.
- **Weight Constraints**: The sum of asset weights must equal 1 (100% of the portfolio).

## Conclusion
Using these variables, we can formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find the optimal asset weights that maximize returns while minimizing risk.
