# Quadratic Portfolio Optimization Plan

## Objective
To maximize the expected return of the portfolio while minimizing risk through diversification.

## Variables

### 1. Asset Returns
- **Expected Returns**: The anticipated return for each asset in the portfolio.

### 2. Asset Weights
- **Weights**: The proportion of the total portfolio value allocated to each asset.

### 3. Covariance Matrix
- **Covariance**: A matrix representing the covariance between the returns of different assets.

### 4. Risk Metrics
- **Volatility**: The standard deviation of asset returns, representing risk.
- **Beta**: A measure of the asset's risk in relation to the market.

### 5. Financial Metrics
- **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: A valuation ratio calculated by dividing the market price per share by the earnings per share.
- **Price to Book (P/B) Ratio**: A ratio used to compare a company's current market price to its book value.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: A measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity.

### 6. Constraints
- **Budget Constraint**: The total investment must equal the available capital.
- **Weight Constraints**: The sum of asset weights must equal 1 (100% of the portfolio).

## Mathematical Formulation of the Optimization Function

The optimization function can be mathematically represented as:

\[
\text{Maximize } E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot E(R_i)
\]

Subject to:

1. **Budget Constraint**:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1
   \]

2. **Weight Constraints**:
   \[
   w_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i
   \]

3. **Risk Adjustment**:
   \[
   \sigma_p^2 = w^T \Sigma w
   \]
   Where \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the portfolio variance and \( \Sigma \) is the covariance matrix of asset returns.

4. **Incorporating Financial Metrics**:
   The expected return can also be adjusted based on financial metrics:
   \[
   E(R_i) = \frac{ROE_i}{P/E_i} + \frac{P/B_i}{MarketCap}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( ROE_i \) is the return on equity for asset \( i \).
   - \( P/E_i \) is the price to earnings ratio for asset \( i \).
   - \( P/B_i \) is the price to book ratio for asset \( i \).
   - \( MarketCap \) is the market capitalization of the portfolio.

5. **Volatility Constraint**:
   \[
   \text{Volatility} = \sqrt{w^T \Sigma w} \leq \text{Target Volatility}
   \]

### Conclusion
Using these variables, we can formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find the optimal asset weights that maximize returns while minimizing risk.
## Optimization Function

To optimize the portfolio, we can define a function that takes the following parameters:

- **market_cap**: 2296700.17 (in millions)
- **asset_turnover**: 0.8006
- **current_ratio**: 2.1491
- **debt_to_equity**: 0.0463
- **return_on_equity**: 0.2952
- **volatility**: 0.21572461094858805

### Function Definition

```python
def optimize_portfolio(market_cap, asset_turnover, current_ratio, debt_to_equity, return_on_equity, price_to_book, price_to_earnings, volatility):
    # Placeholder for optimization logic using relevant variables
    optimal_weights = {}  # This will hold the optimal weights for each asset
    # Implement optimization logic here
    return optimal_weights

# Example usage
optimal_portfolio = optimize_portfolio(
    market_cap=2296700.17,
    asset_turnover=0.8006,
    current_ratio=2.1491,
    debt_to_equity=0.0463,
    return_on_equity=0.2952,
    price_to_book=6.5933,
    price_to_earnings=23.4305,
    volatility=0.21572461094858805
)
```
## Draft Plan for Quadratic Portfolio Optimization

### Objectives
- To maximize the return on equity while minimizing risk.
- To ensure financial stability through constraints on liquidity and debt-to-equity ratios.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather quantitative data from `src/example.json`.
2. **Define Variables**: Identify relevant variables such as market capitalization, asset turnover, current ratio, debt-to-equity, and volatility.
3. **Formulate the Objective Function**: Create a mathematical representation of the optimization goal.
4. **Set Constraints**: Establish limits for total investment, liquidity, and debt-to-equity ratios.
5. **Optimization Process**: Use quadratic programming techniques to find the optimal asset weights.
6. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the outcomes and adjust the model as necessary.

### Expected Outcomes
- A set of optimal asset weights that align with the defined objectives and constraints.
- Insights into the trade-offs between risk and return for the selected assets.
## Hyperparameters and Machine Learning Interventions

### Hyperparameters
- **Risk Aversion Coefficient (\( \lambda \))**: Determines the trade-off between risk and return.
- **Expected Returns (\( E(R_i) \))**: The anticipated return for each asset, which can be estimated using historical data or predictive models.
- **Covariance Matrix (\( \Sigma \))**: Represents the covariance between asset returns, which can be estimated from historical return data.

### Machine Learning Interventions
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use machine learning techniques to clean and preprocess historical return data to improve the accuracy of the covariance matrix estimation.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement algorithms such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal values for the risk aversion coefficient and expected returns.
3. **Model Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the portfolio optimization model and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Employ reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust hyperparameters based on changing market conditions and asset performance.

### Objective
To predict the future price of an asset based on its financial metrics and market conditions.

### Variables
- \( \text{Market Cap} \) (\( MC \)): The market capitalization of the asset.
- \( \text{Asset Turnover} \) (\( AT \)): The asset turnover ratio.
- \( \text{Current Ratio} \) (\( CR \)): The current ratio indicating liquidity.
- \( \text{Debt to Equity} \) (\( DE \)): The debt-to-equity ratio.
- \( \text{Return on Equity} \) (\( ROE \)): The return on equity.
- \( \text{Volatility} \) (\( V \)): The volatility of the asset.

### Mathematical Model
The prediction model can be represented as a quadratic optimization problem:
\[
P = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot MC + \beta_2 \cdot AT + \beta_3 \cdot CR + \beta_4 \cdot DE + \beta_5 \cdot ROE + \beta_6 \cdot V + \beta_7 \cdot MC^2 + \beta_8 \cdot AT^2 + \beta_9 \cdot CR^2 + \beta_{10} \cdot DE^2 + \beta_{11} \cdot ROE^2 + \beta_{12} \cdot V^2
\]
Where:
- \( P \) is the predicted future price.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept of the regression model.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4, \beta_5, \beta_6 \) are the coefficients representing the impact of each variable on the future price.
- \( \beta_7, \beta_8, \beta_9, \beta_{10}, \beta_{11}, \beta_{12} \) are the coefficients for the quadratic terms of each variable.

### Data Collection
Gather historical data for the variables and corresponding future prices to train the model.

### Model Training
Use the historical data to estimate the coefficients (\( \beta \)) of the model using a regression analysis technique.

### Prediction
Once the model is trained, use the current values of the variables to predict the future price.
