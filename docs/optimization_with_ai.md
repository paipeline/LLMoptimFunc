# Optimization with AI Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

Incorporating AI sentiment analysis into traditional optimization methods allows for a more holistic approach to trading strategies. By leveraging sentiment scores derived from news headlines and social media, traders can enhance their decision-making processes and potentially improve their returns.

## Traditional Optimization Functions

1. **Maximizing Returns**: 
   \[
   \text{Maximize } R_T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t \quad \text{(Total Returns)}
   \]

2. **Minimizing Risk**: 
   \[
   \text{Minimize } \text{Var}(R) \quad \text{where } \text{Var}(R) = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (R_t - \bar{R})^2 \quad \text{(Variance of Returns)}
   \]
   Note: Returns data is not available and needs to be simulated or derived.
   \]

3. **Sharpe Ratio Maximization**: 
   \[
   \text{Maximize } S = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma_R} \quad \text{(Sharpe Ratio)}
   \]
   Note: Expected returns and risk-free rate are not defined in the current data.
   \]

## Unified Optimization Function with Sentiment Analysis

Incorporating sentiment analysis into traditional optimization functions allows traders to make more informed decisions based on market sentiment. We can unify the optimization functions into a single function using hyperparameters to define the specific optimization goal. The following unified formula reflects this integration:

\[
\text{Optimize } O = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( R_t + \alpha \cdot S_t \right) - \beta \cdot \text{Var}(R_t + \gamma \cdot S_t) + \delta \cdot \frac{E[R_t + \gamma \cdot S_t] - R_f}{\sigma_R}
\]

where:
- \( R_t \) is the return at time \( t \).
- \( S_t \) is the sentiment score at time \( t \).
- \( \alpha \) is a weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns.
- \( \beta \) is a weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk.
- \( \gamma \) is a weight that reflects the contribution of sentiment to the expected return.
- \( \delta \) is a weight that determines the influence of the Sharpe ratio in the optimization.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_R \) is the standard deviation of returns.
- \( E[R_t + \gamma \cdot S_t] \) is the expected return adjusted by sentiment.

By adjusting the hyperparameters \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), \( \gamma \), and \( \delta \), traders can tailor the optimization function to focus on maximizing returns, minimizing risk, or maximizing the Sharpe ratio with sentiment analysis.

## Variable Definitions and Correspondences

- \( R_T \): Total returns over the time period \( T \). Corresponds to the calculated returns based on stock price movement.
- \( R_t \): Returns at time \( t \). Derived from the stock price movement data in `quantitative_data` -> `stock_price_movement`.
- \( \bar{R} \): Average returns over the time period. Calculated from \( R_t \).
- \( S_t \): Sentiment score at time \( t \). Corresponds to `qualitative_data` -> `sentiment_analysis` -> `sentiment_score`.
- \( \alpha \): Weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns. This is a user-defined parameter.
- \( \text{Var}(R) \): Variance of returns. Calculated from \( R_t \).
- \( R_f \): Risk-free rate. This is a user-defined parameter and not present in the current data.
- \( \sigma_R \): Standard deviation of returns. Derived from the variance calculation.
- \( E[R] \): Expected returns. This is a user-defined parameter and not present in the current data.
- \( \beta \): Weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk. This is a user-defined parameter.
- \( \gamma \): Weight that reflects the contribution of sentiment to the expected return. This is a user-defined parameter.

- \( R_T \): Total returns over the time period \( T \).
- \( R_t \): Returns at time \( t \).
- \( \bar{R} \): Average returns over the time period.
- \( S_t \): Sentiment score at time \( t \).
- \( \alpha \): Weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns.
- \( \text{Var}(R) \): Variance of returns.
- \( R_f \): Risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_R \): Standard deviation of returns.
- \( E[R] \): Expected returns.
- \( \beta \): Weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk.
- \( \gamma \): Weight that reflects the contribution of sentiment to the expected return.

The following data from `example.json` supports the feasibility of the optimization functions:

1. **Market Capitalization**: The market capitalization of `2296700.17` is available in `quantitative_data` -> `company_info` -> `market_cap`, which can be used in return calculations. This represents the total market value of the company's outstanding shares.

2. **Sentiment Scores**: Sentiment scores are available from `qualitative_data` -> `sentiment_analysis`, providing insights into market mood that can be integrated into the optimization functions. These scores reflect the positive or negative sentiment derived from news headlines.

3. **Stock Price Movement**: Historical stock price data is available in `quantitative_data` -> `stock_price_movement`, which can be used to derive returns and assess risk. This includes opening and closing prices over specified periods.

4. **Financial Metrics**: Various financial metrics such as asset turnover, current ratio, and return on equity are available in `quantitative_data` -> `financial_metrics`, which can help in evaluating the company's performance. These metrics provide insights into the company's operational efficiency and financial health.

5. **Risk Metrics**: The volatility of `0.2157` is available in `quantitative_data` -> `risk_metrics`, which can be used in risk calculations. Volatility measures the degree of variation of trading prices over time, indicating the level of risk associated with the asset.

Overall, while some variables require simulation or derivation, the available data provides a solid foundation for implementing the optimization functions effectively.

## Optimization Function Without Sentiment Analysis

For scenarios where sentiment analysis is not considered, we can define a simpler optimization function. This function focuses solely on traditional financial metrics such as returns, risk, and the Sharpe ratio.

\[
\text{Optimize } O = \sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t - \beta \cdot \text{Var}(R_t) + \delta \cdot \frac{E[R_t] - R_f}{\sigma_R}
\]

where:
- \( R_t \) is the return at time \( t \).
- \( \beta \) is a weight that adjusts the impact of risk.
- \( \delta \) is a weight that determines the influence of the Sharpe ratio in the optimization.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_R \) is the standard deviation of returns.
- \( E[R_t] \) is the expected return.

By adjusting the hyperparameters \( \beta \) and \( \delta \), traders can tailor the optimization function to focus on maximizing returns, minimizing risk, or maximizing the Sharpe ratio without considering sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion

By integrating sentiment analysis into traditional optimization functions, traders can create more robust trading strategies that account for market sentiment, potentially leading to improved performance and risk management.
