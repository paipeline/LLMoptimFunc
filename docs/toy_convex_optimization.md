# Toy Version of Convex Optimization

## Introduction

Convex optimization is a method used to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, engineering, and machine learning. The key feature of convex optimization problems is that the objective function is convex, meaning that any local minimum is also a global minimum.

## Basic Concepts

1. **Objective Function**: This is the function we want to minimize or maximize. For example, in a business context, it could represent cost, profit, or risk.

2. **Constraints**: These are the conditions that the solution must satisfy. Constraints can be equalities or inequalities that limit the feasible region of the solution.

3. **Feasible Region**: This is the set of all possible points that satisfy the constraints. The optimal solution lies within this region.

4. **Convex Set**: A set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is also within the set. This property is crucial for ensuring that optimization problems can be solved efficiently.

## Detailed Example: Portfolio Optimization

### Introduction

In this section, we will explore a more detailed example of portfolio optimization using convex optimization principles. The goal is to maximize the expected returns of a portfolio while managing the associated risks.

### Portfolio Optimization Problem

A portfolio optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{maximize}}
& & \mu^T w \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
& & & w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( w \) is the vector of portfolio weights.
- \( \mu \) is the vector of expected returns for each asset.

### Example: Portfolio with Three Assets

1. **Define Expected Returns**: Assume we have three assets with the following expected returns:
   - Asset 1: \( \mu_1 = 0.1 \) (10% expected return)
   - Asset 2: \( \mu_2 = 0.2 \) (20% expected return)
   - Asset 3: \( \mu_3 = 0.15 \) (15% expected return)

2. **Formulate the Optimization Problem**:
   - Objective: Maximize returns \( R = 0.1w_1 + 0.2w_2 + 0.15w_3 \)
   - Constraints:
     - \( w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1 \) (total investment must equal 100%)
     - \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \geq 0 \) (no short selling)

3. **Risk Consideration**: To incorporate risk, we can use the variance of the portfolio returns. The variance can be calculated using the covariance matrix \( \Sigma \) of the asset returns.

4. **Modified Optimization Problem**:
   - Objective: Maximize returns while minimizing risk:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   & \underset{w}{\text{maximize}}
   & & \mu^T w - \frac{\lambda}{2} w^T \Sigma w \\
   & \text{subject to}
   & & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
   & & & w \geq 0
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) is a risk aversion parameter.

5. **Solving the Optimization Problem**: Use a numerical optimization method (e.g., quadratic programming) to find the optimal weights \( w \).

### Conclusion

This detailed example illustrates the principles of portfolio optimization using convex optimization techniques. By maximizing expected returns while managing risk, investors can make informed decisions about asset allocation.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective portfolio management and can lead to improved financial outcomes.

Imagine you want to minimize the cost of producing a product while ensuring that you meet certain quality standards. This can be represented as a convex optimization problem:

- **Objective**: Minimize cost \( C(x) \)
- **Constraints**: 
  - Quality must be above a certain threshold \( Q(x) \geq Q_{min} \)
  - Production capacity must not be exceeded \( x \leq x_{max} \)

## Data Extraction Plan Using Financial Metrics

To perform monthly portfolio optimization, we need to extract relevant financial data. The following variables will be collected based on the financial metrics available in the dataset:

1. **Assets**: The list of assets to be included in the portfolio (e.g., stocks, bonds).
   - Example: `['GOOGL']`

2. **Expected Returns (\( \mu \))**: The expected monthly returns for each asset.
   - This can be calculated using historical price data. For example, if the stock price movement shows a decrease from $176.92 to $176.4, the return can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Return} = \frac{\text{Closing Price} - \text{Opening Price}}{\text{Opening Price}} = \frac{176.4 - 176.92}{176.92} \approx -0.0029
     \]

3. **Covariance Matrix (\( \Sigma \))**: The covariance matrix representing the risk associated with the assets.
   - This can be derived from historical return data. Use the historical returns of the assets to calculate the covariance using statistical libraries in Python (e.g., NumPy or Pandas).

4. **Sentiment Scores (\( S \))**: The sentiment scores for each asset, which can be derived from news articles or social media.
   - Example: Sentiment scores from the qualitative data can be averaged to represent the overall sentiment for the asset.

5. **Risk-Free Rate (\( R_f \))**: The risk-free rate for the period, typically based on government bond yields.
   - Example: Use a standard value such as `R_f = 0.005` (monthly).

6. **Financial Metrics**: Additional financial metrics that can be used to inform the optimization process:
   - **Asset Turnover**: `0.8006`
   - **Current Ratio**: `2.1491`
   - **Debt to Equity**: `0.0463`
   - **Return on Equity**: `0.2952`
   - **Price to Book**: `6.5933`
   - **Price to Earnings**: `23.4305`

### Timeframe

The data extraction will focus on the previous 12 months to calculate the expected returns and covariance matrix. The monthly data points will be used to perform the optimization at the end of each month.

### Data Sources

1. **Historical Prices**: Fetch historical price data for each asset from a financial API (e.g., Alpha Vantage).
2. **Financial Metrics**: Retrieve financial metrics for each asset to calculate expected returns and assess risk.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use sentiment analysis tools to derive sentiment scores from relevant news articles or social media posts.

### Example Variables and Data Sources

- **Assets**: `['GOOGL']`
- **Expected Returns**: `mu = [calculated_return]` (monthly returns)
- **Covariance Matrix**: `Sigma = [[calculated_covariance]]`
- **Sentiment Scores**: `S = [average_sentiment_score]`
- **Risk-Free Rate**: `R_f = 0.005` (monthly)
- **Financial Metrics**: 
  - Asset Turnover: `0.8006`
  - Current Ratio: `2.1491`
  - Debt to Equity: `0.0463`
  - Return on Equity: `0.2952`
  - Price to Book: `6.5933`
  - Price to Earnings: `23.4305`

Understanding these financial metrics and their implications can enhance the portfolio optimization process, leading to more informed investment decisions.
