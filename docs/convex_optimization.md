# Convex Optimization Formula

## Introduction

Convex optimization is a subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. Convex optimization problems are important because they can be solved efficiently and reliably, and they have a wide range of applications in various fields such as finance, engineering, and machine learning.

## Convex Optimization Problem

A convex optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}
& & f(x) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& & & h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( f(x) \) is the objective function, which is convex.
- \( g_i(x) \) are the inequality constraint functions, which are convex.
- \( h_j(x) \) are the equality constraint functions, which are affine (i.e., linear).

## Convex Optimization with Sentiment Analysis

Incorporating sentiment analysis into convex optimization allows for a more comprehensive approach to portfolio management. By leveraging sentiment scores, we can enhance the optimization process to potentially improve returns and manage risk more effectively.

### Maximizing Returns with Sentiment Analysis

To maximize returns while considering sentiment analysis, we can modify the objective function to include sentiment scores. The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{maximize}}
& & \mu^T w + \alpha \cdot S^T w \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
& & & w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( w \) is the vector of portfolio weights.
- \( \mu \) is the vector of expected returns.
- \( S \) is the vector of sentiment scores.
- \( \alpha \) is a weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns.
- \( \mathbf{1} \) is a vector of ones.

### Minimizing Risk with Sentiment Analysis

To minimize risk while considering sentiment analysis, we can adjust the risk function to account for sentiment scores. The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{minimize}}
& & \frac{1}{2} w^T \Sigma w - \beta \cdot S^T w \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
& & & w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( w \) is the vector of portfolio weights.
- \( \Sigma \) is the covariance matrix of asset returns.
- \( S \) is the vector of sentiment scores.
- \( \beta \) is a weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk.
- \( \mathbf{1} \) is a vector of ones.

### Unified Convex Optimization Function with Sentiment Analysis

We can unify the optimization functions into a single function using hyperparameters to define the specific optimization goal. The following unified formula reflects this integration:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{optimize}}
& & \mu^T w + \alpha \cdot S^T w - \beta \cdot \frac{1}{2} w^T \Sigma w + \delta \cdot \frac{E[\mu^T w + \gamma \cdot S^T w] - R_f}{\sigma_w} \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
& & & w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( w \) is the vector of portfolio weights.
- \( \mu \) is the vector of expected returns.
- \( S \) is the vector of sentiment scores.
- \( \Sigma \) is the covariance matrix of asset returns.
- \( \alpha \) is a weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns.
- \( \beta \) is a weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk.
- \( \gamma \) is a weight that reflects the contribution of sentiment to the expected return.
- \( \delta \) is a weight that determines the influence of the Sharpe ratio in the optimization.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_w \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
- \( E[\mu^T w + \gamma \cdot S^T w] \) is the expected return adjusted by sentiment.

By adjusting the hyperparameters \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), \( \gamma \), and \( \delta \), traders can tailor the optimization function to focus on maximizing returns, minimizing risk, or maximizing the Sharpe ratio with sentiment analysis.
