# Convex Optimization Formula

## Introduction

Convex optimization is a subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. Convex optimization problems are important because they can be solved efficiently and reliably, and they have a wide range of applications in various fields such as finance, engineering, and machine learning.

## Convex Optimization Problem

A convex optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}
& & f(x) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& & & h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( f(x) \) is the objective function, which is convex.
- \( g_i(x) \) are the inequality constraint functions, which are convex.
- \( h_j(x) \) are the equality constraint functions, which are affine (i.e., linear).

## Integrating API Data and Machine Learning with Convex Optimization

Combining machine learning with convex optimization involves using machine learning models to predict parameters or constraints that are then used in a convex optimization problem. This approach leverages the predictive power of machine learning and the efficiency of convex optimization.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Fetching Data from an API**:
   - Use an API to fetch relevant financial data. This data can include historical prices, financial metrics, and sentiment scores.

2. **Predicting Parameters with Machine Learning**:
   - Use machine learning models to predict expected returns (\( \mu \)), risk (covariance matrix \( \Sigma \)), and sentiment scores (\( S \)).
   - For example, regression models can predict expected returns, time series models can predict risk, and sentiment analysis models can predict sentiment scores.

3. **Formulating the Convex Optimization Problem**:
   - Use the predicted parameters in the convex optimization problem to maximize returns or minimize risk.

### Example: Portfolio Optimization

In portfolio optimization, machine learning models can be used to predict expected returns, risk, and sentiment scores. These predictions can then be incorporated into a convex optimization problem to determine the optimal portfolio weights.

1. **Fetching Data from an API**:
   - Fetch data such as historical prices, financial metrics, and sentiment scores from an API.

2. **Predicting Parameters with Machine Learning**:
   - Use regression models to predict expected returns (\( \mu \)).
   - Use time series models to predict risk (covariance matrix \( \Sigma \)).
   - Use sentiment analysis models to predict sentiment scores (\( S \)).

3. **Formulating the Convex Optimization Problem**:
   - Use the predicted parameters in the convex optimization problem to maximize returns or minimize risk.

### Unified Optimization Function

The unified optimization function can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{optimize}}
& & \mu^T w + \alpha \cdot S^T w - \beta \cdot \frac{1}{2} w^T \Sigma w + \delta \cdot \frac{E[\mu^T w + \gamma \cdot S^T w] - R_f}{\sigma_w} \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{1}^T w = 1 \\
& & & w \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
- \( w \) is the vector of portfolio weights.
- \( \mu \) is the vector of predicted expected returns.
- \( S \) is the vector of predicted sentiment scores.
- \( \Sigma \) is the predicted covariance matrix of asset returns.
- \( \alpha \) is a weight that determines the influence of sentiment on returns.
- \( \beta \) is a weight that adjusts the impact of sentiment on risk.
- \( \gamma \) is a weight that reflects the contribution of sentiment to the expected return.
- \( \delta \) is a weight that determines the influence of the Sharpe ratio in the optimization.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_w \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
- \( E[\mu^T w + \gamma \cdot S^T w] \) is the expected return adjusted by sentiment.

By adjusting the hyperparameters \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), \( \gamma \), and \( \delta \), traders can tailor the optimization function to focus on maximizing returns, minimizing risk, or maximizing the Sharpe ratio with sentiment analysis.
